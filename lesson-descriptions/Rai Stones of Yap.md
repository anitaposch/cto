YouTube title: The Fascinating History of Money: Unveiling the Rai Stones of Yap and their Bitcoin Connection

## Description

In this lesson, I want to make you familiar with the history of money, which is very interesting and a little bit similar to Bitcoin, the Rai Stones of Yap. If Bitcoin sounds mind-boggling to you and you can't grasp the concept of a blockchain as a shared ledger of truth. The Rai of the aisle of Yap is a good example to introduce some overlapping concepts. Rai are large stone discs that you can see in that image, which were used on the Yap island in the Western Pacific in Micronesia. That's on that map. It's a very, very small island, close to Palau. And those Rai stones were minted from the lime limestone deposits of the island of Palau, which was quite far away at that time, and it was used as a currency until the 20th century. The Rai stones were brought to Yap via boat and due to their size and weight were are not moved when spent, but simply changed owners. Every transaction was recorded orally within the small community with the Stone's ownership history becoming common knowledge. Eventually, the transaction, like the history became the only part that mattered. A stone was once dropped by the canoe, transferring it to Yap and it sank. The stone was deemed to still be money since it still existed, even though no one has seen or had access to it since. That's particularly important because it demonstrates a naturally occuring use of a ledger of transactions. The ledger was shared orally between the inhabitants and attributed ownership and delegated property without a single stone moving. Everyone agreed on it and a consensus was formed and this history as well as this ledger, you also can compare to the Bitcoin blockchain because the Bitcoin blockchain is saving all transactions that have ever happened on the Bitcoin blockchain since 2009. This database is stored on thousands of computers worldwide wide in a synchronized manner. So you can also compare the Bitcoin blockchain, this ledger of transactions like a Google sheet, a Google sheet that is shared by thousands of people and everyone can see what's inside in a synchronous manner. So another similarity to Bitcoin is actually the creation of Ray Stone, which was very work intense and a form of proof of work. The stones were carved out with hand tools carried overseas and brought to the island via canoe. Once the Rai stones became easy to manufacture with modern techniques, they became less useful as money because they were no longer a reliable indicator of energy spent. If you can produce money easily, then it loses value. It has no value. Rai stones have been viewed by modern economists as a primitive form of money and are often used as an example to support the thesis that the value of some forms of money can be assigned purely through a shared belief. In said value, today's money isn't backed by anything either. In fact, it's only established and declared legal tender by government regulation only because of that. It is the medium of account we use and therefore it is perceived as valuable.
