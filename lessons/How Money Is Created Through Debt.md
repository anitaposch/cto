## Transcript

Now we take a look at how money is being created by loans and debt. So Alice, for instance, has a hundred dollars and wants to deposit that into the bank. The bank then gives a loan to Bob. It's a loan of a hundred dollars. Bob then has to work for that to pay off the loan. And he does not only have to pay back the loan, he also has to pay back interest rates on that loan. So he basically pays back $110 to the bank. And that's why a loan is actually an asset for the bank because they get more without doing anything, while a deposit is more of a liability because they have to give Alice the money back when she wants it. And there we also need to talk about banking risks. So let's take that example again. Alice is depositing a hundred dollars into the bank. Bob wants to have a loan, and the bank can only give him $90 because they have to have a fractional reserve in the bank. They have to have at least $10, like 10%. But many banks don't even have that requirement anymore. Most banks in the US, as far as I know, can, can actually lend out all the money they have. They don't have to keep any reserve anymore. So Bob takes out a loan of $90 and then Alice comes along and says, Hey, I want my money back. And the bank tells her, sorry, but we don't have your money because we lent it out to someone else. And that's why Alice actually, although she has the money in the first place, is a liability to the bank. And on the other hand, as we said before, Bob has to deliver the loan back, including interest on top of it. And that's why he's an asset. And then we need to look into fractional reserve banking. How does this work? As I said before, in many countries, like the US and I also think in the UK, banks don't really need to have any reserves anymore. These requirements were basically deleted or taken off from them, during the Corona CRI crisis. So Alice, same example, has a hundred dollars. She wants to deposit that in the bank. Bob takes a loan of $90 and the bank has a reserve of $10. That means in the overall economical system, we now have $190 in a ledger because the bank has the deposit. On the other side, they lent out the money to Bob. So it's $190 in this system, and the bank is holding $10 as a reserve. Then Bob spends this $90 on something he's buying from Mary. Mary wants to deposit these $90 into the bank. So the bank has an additional reserve of $9 and gives a loan out to be for $81. So the system now has $271 and the bank only a reserve of 19. And on and on and on it goes. And in the end, you see that's how we are going into these huge debt spirals where the banks, if we all were to go to the bank today to get back our deposits, the bank would need to close and shut down. They can't pay you back that money. And that's why this system is so fragile. So in that system, in the end now, we would have $344 and the bank has only 27.
