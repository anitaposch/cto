## Transcript

Maybe you can remember the textbook definition of money, which said: 
- Bitcoin is not money because it's not a store of value. The value doesn't remain stable.
- It's not a medium of exchange because it's not widely accepted in exchange for goods and services.
- And it's also not a medium of account because it's not really used as a measure for prices, costs and profits. Just a few people like Bitcoiners, like me and maybe you in the future, are using bitcoin in exchange for goods and services.

That is true. And it's also not the textbook definition of money because at the moment the financial system is definitely used as a system of control. Banks are being deputized to surveil and police us. This starts when you are opening an account on a bank. They will ask you for your identity documents, your income, your everything, basically, your residential address if you really live there and things like that. So it's the banks that are basically used as a police force. 

And just as an example: A friend of mine told me that on Christmas time she started to collect donations for one of the boys of her maid in Zimbabwe. And she asked her friends, she said, instead of buying stuff that no one really needs, because here in Europe we have everything, why don't you just donate a small amount to me and I will give it to the boy to pay for the school fees? And the thing was that the bank in Austria saw that there were 10 or 20 incoming payments about like maybe from 20 euros to 100 euros or maybe 200 euros, not more. But the bank called her to say, the next time she's doing something like this, she has to set up an association, an NGO, basically, to be able to receive donations and give it to that child. And I mean, how laughable is that? And it's all about money laundering as if we, regular people, would do money laundering. It's really not about us. It's about the big banks and everyone. They are those who basically commit the crimes, not us. 

So Bitcoin is not money. That's true. It's not money after that textbook definition, because you can't use Bitcoin as a system of control. And I have that term from Andreas Antonopoulos. You can see the link to that video where he speaks about money as a system of control the below the video. And I really recommend you watch that video because Andreas is one of the best and he really, really, really can explain things in a great way. So how can you exit that system of control? What are the alternatives? Well, of course, Bitcoin is an alternative or actually the only alternative. And in the next chapters I will show you how you can use Bitcoin in that self-sovereign way.
