## Transcript

Okay, now we were speaking about mining. And it's also very important to understand or to have heard about Bitcoin halving. What is a Bitcoin halving? The total supply of bitcoin is limited to 21 million. You've heard that before. 19.3 million are already on the market and every four years, which is exactly 210,000 blocks of Bitcoin, as we've seen before, the amount of bitcoin that is minted is reduced by half. That's why it's called a halving. 

Currently, when a miner wins a block, he or they get 6.25 bitcoin. So every 10 minutes, 6.25 bitcoin are issued. That is 900 bitcoin per day and 328,500 bitcoin per year. From next year on there will only be 450 bitcoin minted per day as only 3.125. bitcoin will be issued for each block generated. This means that the amount available every day decreases and the supply becomes scarcer. And if interest in bitcoin rises at the same time, the price of bitcoin will rise.

So here on that slide, we can see the Halvings over the last years. So the first Bitcoin Halving was on November 28th, 2012. Back then, the amount of issued bitcoin was reduced by half from 50 bitcoin to 25 bitcoin. Then we had a Halving in 2016, and the last one in May, 2020. And it's expected that the next Halving will occur on April 21st in 2024. We're not able to say that exactly because as I said, it's every 210,000 blocks and the block time where blocks are added to the blockchain is usually or should always be around 10 minutes, but sometimes it isn't. So that's why we don't know exactly on which day it will happen, but it will be in 2024, in April. 

Here is a slide where I show you the decrease in the supply of bitcoin over the years. So, now we are in that phase between 2020 and 2024, where 6.25 Bitcoin are mined or minted every block, every 10 minutes. And from 2024 on, it will be 3.125. And that is also the way how the supply is ending then in 2140 (around that year), because then, the 3.125 Bitcoin have been halved, halved, halved, halved, halved until there is no more bitcoin to be issued. And from that moment on, the miners will receive as an incentive the transaction fees only. And that is why we need to pay transaction fees because the mining will proceed, it will go on after 2140 because mining, as you already know, is securing the whole blockchain. It's securing the whole system. It's not just the issuing of new bitcoin. So this algorithm tends to zero  so that we are at the end around 2140. And by that point, it is expected that Bitcoin as a network will have such a high adoption, that transaction fees alone will adequately facilitate fair reward for the miners. 

On that slide, you can see how the supply limit is de determined. Andreas Antonopoulos explained how the C++ code in the Bitcoin core client is working that will make the Bitcoin halving happen. And you can also see that coded into the software in C++. Looks like that. I mean, I'm not a developer, so I can't really explain it, but what you can see is that here you have the subsidy, it started with 50 that was at the beginning, and then you have the Halving. And here's also the comment, the subsidy is cut in half every 210,000 blocks, which will occur approximately every four years. So that's the part that makes the halving happen.
