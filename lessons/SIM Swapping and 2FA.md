## Transcript

Another big, big danger, especially in the US and I also think in many African countries, is SIM swapping. A SIM swapping attack is when someone is hijacking your SIM and telephone number. They can then use your phone number to log into all connected accounts where you activated two factor authentication with text SMS. So SIM swapping is an attack to get into your primary email account. If the attackers can access the primary email account that is associated with wo factor authentication to your phone number, they can find all the Bitcoin exchange accounts you are using with 2FA and wipe them out. The attack is often started by calling customer services at your telecom provider. They say something along the lines of "I'm the owner of the phone number, I lost my phone. Please transfer my number to my new SIM." The customer services person will ask for a piece of personal information to verify your identity. The attackers will then try a lot of tricks. They batch the support person to get small bits of information from them, hang up and call someone else, and use that snippet on information to build to the next level. They then get more information and keep building until they have enough information to persuade the last person that they are the account owner and get the SIM transferred. They then will go after all crypto exchanges where you might have set up an account with your email address and phone number. When they know your email, they will try to change your account password with the forgot password functionality. Good sites will not tell them if the account exists, but the attackers will try to do a password reset or try to get a text message verification. 

Don't use SMS or text messages two factor authentication. Use authenticators like the Google Authenticator or the Aegis Authenticator because then it's not connected to your phone number. The idea behind two factor authentication is to confirm on a second device that you really want to enter and it's really you who wants to get into an account.
