Now let's talk a little bit about strategies that hopefully lead to wealth creation for you and some tips and recommendations on that. I'm not a financial advisor, okay, so I only speak about what I have learned so far and don't take my word for that. But I recommend you create something like a savings plan. So procure a small sum of Bitcoin periodically, like every day, every week, or every month. This is also known as dollar cost averaging or fiat cost averaging. That means by spacing out your purchases, you balance out the volatility of Bitcoin's price over a longer period of time. So if you look at the graph I made, you can see, if you buy in that time periods where the vertical lines are, you in the end have an average price. So, it's never too late to start using Bitcoin and acquiring Bitcoin because over the time you will have this average price. There are some Bitcoin-only cost average services, and some even work without Know Your Customer identification as long as you stay under a certain limit. You can get the links in the list underneath the video. Trading: There are countless trading experts online who tell beginners how to time the market and predict the movement of Bitcoin's price. They try to sell you trading software and seminars. Don't do that. I mean, at least for me, don't spend your time and money on trying to do that because you can't time the market. It's only the big players that will get you wrecked, meaning they will ruin you. And on top of that, you will pay a lot of trading fees. And keep in mind that you may have to drag all the trading movements for tax reasons. In some countries, your Bitcoin gains are tax free if you do not exchange the coins for 12 months. But each trade can be a new taxable event and the period starts new, the waiting period. In other countries, every rate is taxable. There are services that help you make reports for the tax authorities, and then these services collect your transaction data to calculate the taxes you need to pay. So be aware that the tax authorities in the end will request access to these data collections. It might not be in the near future, but I'm sure that authorities will use cryptocurrency tracking systems soon if they not already do. I'm not a tax advisor, but what I say is, please inform yourself about the regulations and tax requirements in your jurisdiction. The Bitcoin blockchain, as you know by now, is transparent and more and more tax authorities will require exchanges to hand them their trading data. So keep proofs of your purchases in case authorities start investigating. But in general, it's better to not acquire your Bitcoin at regulated and KYC exchanges anyhow. So diversifying altcoins: we already spoke about that in an earlier lesson and Bitcoin is still the first mover and the asset with the biggest network effect. And, so my personal opinion just as a repetition is: if you want to diversify, buy a house, purchase a property, by gold and deepen your knowledge, it's not a diversification. If you invest in a similar asset that even has higher risks and volatility than Bitcoin, then I always hear people: "Oh, I'm much too late. Bitcoin is too expensive now" and whatever. So here you see someone in 2013 saying "Did I miss an opportunity?" At what point would you say it is too high to buy? Well, I say, it's never too late. It's never too early. It's never too late to buy Bitcoin or to learn about it and to use it. So it doesn't matter. You don't need to ask yourself, what if I had done it in 2014? Yeah, I mean, if you had, you might be rich today, but on the other hand, you might have lost your Bitcoin. So many people lost access to their Bitcoin or they spent it because they thought, okay, the price is now at $1,000, it won't get higher anytime. So I rather buy something with my Bitcoin and then they spent it. So, we are still in the early days, if you are starting to educate yourself and use Bitcoin now, you are still leaks ahead of the masses and it's never too late to start learning about Bitcoin. So you are in the right course at that moment.
