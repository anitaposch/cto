## Transcript

And what's also very important is physical security. Never use your residence address as a shipping address if you are buying a hardware wallet. As it happened to me with the ledger hack, the hackers knew and it's widely in the internet that I bought a hardware wallet means I'm a cryptocurrency user and my residence address was on and in that database. So don't do that. Get a PO box, send it to an office, to your office. Try to send it somewhere else, but not to where you live. Otherwise, one day maybe someone is going to visit you and that's not funny. I'm by the way, not living at that address anymore. I will never, ever do that again. I just did it because I have thought I want that hardware wallet urgently. I need it fast. I don't have the time to set up a PO box or find another solution. This is silly and I will never do that again. And this is also my recommendation to you. That was the chapter of security while using Bitcoin.
