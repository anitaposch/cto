## Transcript

Okay, now let's turn to the people who will tell you that Bitcoin has already failed. It has failed because after 14 years, more people should use Bitcoin. 

And since the use of Bitcoin in principle is not tied to identities, it's not statistically possible to know how many people really are using Bitcoin. Also, the number of Bitcoin addresses, which is very often used to make assumptions about how many people use Bitcoin, is not really a good indicator because one person can have millions of Bitcoin addresses and the other way around. A big exchange, for instance, can manage the bitcoin of thousands of users under one address. 

So, but as we have KYC exchanges that identify all the users, we also have numbers from that exchanges. And that is not bitcoin, that's cryptocurrency in general. So as we see here on that scale, on the chart, last year we had 402 million cryptocurrency users globally who are registered or have been registered at a cryptocurrency exchange. Let's make a rough calculation on Bitcoin users. If we have 400 million crypto asset users worldwide on these KYC exchanges and 46% is the market share of bitcoin, we could say we have around 184 million Bitcoin users globally (that are only those on exchanges). So I think that's rather much for an invention that started in 2009 when it had a value of zero and no one was interested in it in the first years. And there's also not a marketing department for Bitcoin. 

Then here is a survey, uh, which was asking people how common is crypto? Meaning have you ever used or owned a cryptocurrency? That's from the year 2020. And as you can see, 32% of the people in that survey in Nigeria said, yes, I have owned or used Bitcoin and other currencies before. Vietnam 20%, Philippines 20%, Turkey 16%. It's not a surprise that these are countries with high inflation and also sometimes with not so democratic leaderships. And keep in mind that the Nigerian population, for instance, is on average 19 years old, compared to the US  average age of 38 and Germany's median age of 44 years. So the people in Nigeria are young, they want to work, they are tech-savvy, and they value cryptocurrencies despite their volatility because their own national currency, the Naira is losing over 25% of its value per year. So those people already got it. They know that Bitcoin is basically a safe haven for them compared to the national currency.
