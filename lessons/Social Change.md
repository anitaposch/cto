One of the, for me, most important reasons why I'm in Bitcoin is the social change, which is going to happen and which it enables. If we take a look on that slide, you can see the democracy index, and you can see that 55% of the global population are living under authoritarian systems. So 37% are real true authoritarian regimes, 18% hybrid regimes, and 47% flawed democracies. It's only 8% of the global population who live in a sort of a full democracy. And that's getting worse. So in the last years, in 2020, we had 50% of people living under authoritarian regimes, and now it's almost 55%. As noted before, it's people in the Global South who will drive the Bitcoin adoption forward.
