## Transcript

So let's look into the internet of money. Why Bitcoin is the new system. Why is it so revolutionary? We just said that many blockchains are basically permissioned. That's a system that we don't need. But Bitcoin is not only open and neutral, it's also a common good. It's like public infrastructure. We can compare it to the internet. The internet started in 1969 in the US and as you can see here, there were only four connections in 1969. And it grew over the years into that system that we know today, where almost everyone in the world who has access to a smartphone and to the internet can be connected and can send messages to everyone around the world almost for free. 

And that system has revolutionized our life. And that's the same which will happen with Bitcoin. One can also compare a the Bitcoin blockchain and the whole Bitcoin network system with the internet a little bit. So  the internet we have something like TCP IP protocols. That's basically the general base layer of the internet. That's what the Bitcoin blockchain also represents. It's a cryptographic ledger, which on which Bitcoin is running. Then we have a so-called application protocol layer that would be comparable with the SMTP layer, which is the technology on which we send emails and the Bitcoin protocol is there to transfer the Bitcoin cryptocurrency.

On top of that, in the internet, we have something like Gmail or Outlook programs and apps with which you can send the e-mails and receive e-mails, and in Bitcoin that would be the digital currency. That's basically the application running on the Bitcoin blockchain. And then it sounds complicated, but it's just for you to visualize how it can be compared with the internet. We have something like the Lightning Network, which is a so-called second layer protocol. And on top of that, we have applications for the Lightning Network, like Lightning Wallets, and services like BTCpodcasting where you can host your podcast and receive Satoshis and things like that. It goes to show that there will be loads of applications and services on top of Bitcoin. As an example, I mean a lot of people will drive electric cars in the future. There's already a service in Europe where you can, charge your electric vehicle with Bitcoin. And they already have quite a huge number of these loading stations in Europe. And that's the future. So Bitcoin is not only money for the people, it's also money that can be used by machines to pay themselves.
