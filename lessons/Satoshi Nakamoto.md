## Transcript

Hello. In that lesson, we are taking a look at who is Satoshi Nakamoto. So actually no one really knows who Satoshi Nakamoto is, and this puzzle may never be solved because there is no Satoshi Nakamoto, the name is a pseudonym. It could be an individual or a group of cryptographers programmers and scientists who invented Bitcoin. We don't know that, and I think we will never know. 

On August 18, in 2008, an unknown person registered the domain bitcoin.org by registering the domain with the help of a company in Panama, the anonymity of the person is protected to this day. On October 1st in 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto appeared on the cryptography mailing list and explained in a message that they had been working on an electronic cash system and posted the link to the Bitcoin whitepaper on bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf. You can see that link below the video. Nakamoto stated that the work on writing of the code for Bitcoin began already in 2007. This is the first public block, the so-called Bitcoin Genesis block and Satoshi Nakamoto mined this block on January 3rd. And that's also the reason why since then January 3rd is basically the day where Bitcoin's birthday has been celebrated. 

The first person who communicated with Satoshi Nakamoto after they presented the white paper was a guy called Hal Finney. Hal Finney was a cryptographer, and he was the first to also run a node. So he was the first who installed the Bitcoin software on his computer and did the first Bitcoin transactions with Satoshi Nakamoto. And on January 11th, 2009, that was one week after Satoshi started the blockchain. Hal Finney wrote on Twitter, I'm running Bitcoin. And Hal Finney sadly died of a nerve disease sometime later. And until now, people are speculating and thinking that Hal Finney was maybe Satoshi Nakamoto. But there are also other people who are believed to be Satoshi Nakamoto. That's for instance Beck. I spoke befor about him. He is the inventor of Hashcash, the mining mechanism that is used as proof of work in Bitcoin. But Beck always declines and says, no, he's not Satoshi. He was coming later on into the Bitcoin space. So he can't be it. 

Also Satoshi Nakamoto left a lot of traces and ideas about what can be meant with Bitcoin and things like that. But one thing is very, very clear. Satoshi Nakamoto listed their birthday as April 5th, 1975. April 5th was the same date as executive order 6102 was signed by US President Roosevelt in 1933. And that executive order required all persons to deliver on or before May 1st all, but a small amount of gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates owned by them to the Federal Reserve. That basically means that there was a ban on owning gold for US Americans. And I'm very pretty sure that that's a message from Satoshi Nakamoto to us telling us, be aware Bitcoin might be banned. And that's the reason why I'm for very high privacy in Bitcoin. And also that you acquire your Bitcoin in a way without being listed in so-called "know your customer identification schemes" because as, as soon as you are registered like that, your Bitcoin are attached to your identity. And so if ever in any country a ban of Bitcoin would come along, the government immediately knows that you are owning Bitcoin. And it's not illegal, it's totally okay and legal to obtain Bitcoin without KYC and how that works. I will show in later lessons. And the second hint Satoshi gave us with his birthdate April 5th, 1975, is that in the year 1975, it became legal again for US Americans to own gold. And the executive order had the number 6102. And the difficulty adjustment in Bitcoin is every 2016 blocks. Okay, so that's numerology in a way. 

Until April 23rd, 2011, Satoshi Nakamoto participated in discussions about the Bitcoin network, answered questions from other developers, explained new features of the software, and outlined some motives behind it. The last message possibly left by Satoshi Nakamoto was in March, 2014 when a report about the alleged identification of the so-called Bitcoin inventor, Dorian Nakamoto on the slide went through the media. So Newsweek put out the big story about Dorian Nakamoto and how he is the Bitcoin creator, but it's not true. 

So basically we still don't know who it is or who it was. Now you can see the last message that Satoshi left. It's an email to Mike Hearn, where Satoshi Nakamoto says, I've moved on to other things. It's in good hands with Gavin and everyone. By "Gavin and everyone" he means the Bitcoin developers.
