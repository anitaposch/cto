Hello. This is another lesson in my online learning program Crack The Orange. And this one is about a very, very important topic. It's about how to protect your seed. Especially if your seed is the self-custody of your life savings, you will want to make sure that you have a very, very well maintained backup. We're going through the tips and recommendations I'm going to give you on that topic. 

I call it the 3-2-1 rule for storing your seed. Now, you've written down the 12 or 24 words that are your seed phrase, which are managing all your bitcoin on the Bitcoin blockchain. Why do I say 12 or 24 words? Well, today actually, it's enough, it's cryptographically secure enough, if you're using a wallet that gives you 12 words instead of 24. 12 words are simply easier to remember than 24 words. And it's also easier to store them and back them up. So when you initialize a new wallet, write down the 12 or 24 words in the order the wallet is giving it to you. Do not change the order of the terms because that's important to have it in the correct order. Check the words you've written down multiple times. I'm always reading it from the front to the back and then from the back to the front again. Once I actually miswrote one word, I tried to restore my funds, and then that one word was wrong. You can imagine how great my fear was that the seed phrase isn't correct and that I don't regain access to my bitcoin. But I found out the wrong word and everything was back to good again. But just for you to remember, really take care of that, especially if it's about your life savings. 

And then also what's important is that you write down the wallet manufacturer, the vendor, the model, if it's a hardware device, and which wallet software you're using. Write that down too, because later on it can be that you might need it yourself if you want to recover your funds or your heirs will need it in the future. 

There are tutorials in that program where I show you how to set up a hardware wallet. Of course, a seed on a paper alone is not the most secure backup of your seed phrase. That's the reason why people laminate their seed phrases, or instance, the paper. Or they buy a steel plate like this, where they engrave the seed onto the steel. So in case of fire, the seed phrase doesn't get lost. 

Jameson Lopp, one of my guests on the podcast, is always doing tests of these steel plates because they should not lose the seed in case of fire, of course. His tests, you can find them at anita.link/metalseed. The link is also below the video. 

So what is the 3-2-1 for backing up your seed now? Well, you should write down the seed at least three times on at least two different media, like laminated paper or a steel plate. Choose different places for it, for instance, a bank vault or another secret place that only you know. And then store one of these 3 copies of the seed phrase in a place that's at least 100 km away from where the others are.
