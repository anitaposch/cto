## Transcription

So now after we were talking about how monetary supply inflation comes along, I want to talk about Ponzi schemes. A lot of people think that Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme, and I have to say, yes it's sad but there are a lot of scams built with the word Bitcoin. So for example, people pretending they sell someone bitcoin, which they don't really because it's just a scam. But now talking about a Ponzi scheme, some people also believe Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme. 

What is a Ponzi scheme? It's a form of fraud in which belief in the success of effective enterprise is fostered by payment of quick returns to the first investors from money invested by others. And the name Ponzi scheme comes from Charles Ponzi. He promised in the early 1900s, to double the money that people put into his scheme within three months. He said, we can pay you 50% interest. And many people believed these lies, and there were long lines at Ponzis office who invested into his notes, into his Ponzi scheme. Back then, it didn't have the bad name, as it does now.

This is Mr. Ponzis signing his Ponzi notes and actually he was arrested in 1920 for taking $20 million from tens of thousands of victims. As I said, his promise was to double the money. And in return for cash, the investors received promissory notes that guaranteed the original investment plus 50% interest. These notes from Ponzi had an ink stamped signature, and many refer to them as Ponzi notes. You can find a link down at the bottom of this video at Anita.link/ponzi where you can read more about Mr. Charles Ponzi and his ideas and his life. A quote from Charles Ponzi goes: "My business was simple. It was the old game of robbing Peter to pay Paul. You would give me a hundred dollars and I would give you a note to pay you $150 in three months... My notes became more valuable than American money and then came trouble. The whole thing was broken." 

And now, I would like to compare the characteristics of the Ponzi scheme to Fiat money creation and how money creation works in Bitcoin. A Ponzi scheme has a centralized actor like Mr. Ponzi. It's not audible, it's not transparent, nobody knows what he's doing with that money. There is no money supply limit. He just creates notes after notes, and then he gets into difficulty in repaying investors, of course, because he takes all the money and steals it. And that system simply has to break one day. The loans or the money that a Ponzi scheme is creating and giving out is no real contribution to the economy. Greed is driving the Ponzi scheme. Everybody hears about that promise and everybody wants to join the investment too. 

Let's see what Fiat money creation is like. Well, we have a centralized actor, central banks, and governments. It's not audible and not transparent. We don't know what's really in the ledgers of the banks. There's also no money supply limit, as you know, money is created through lending and through debt, and there's no limit on that. Banks run into difficulties to repay investors. That system also has to break one day, we only don't know when. What we're doing now is kicking the can down the road and do same thing all over again. The loaning of the money is not a contribution to the economy. And also greed is driving the fiat system. 

Whereas Bitcoin, is decentralized. It's auditable and transparent. It has a money supply limit of 21 million bitcoin. There are no investors in Bitcoin in that sense. So some people say, I invested in Bitcoin. Yes, okay, you changed your own field currency or national currency to Bitcoin and now you are holding it but you don't invest in a company or something like that. The system has no breaking point because it's self-regulated and it can't be inflated. Bitcoin creation is not built on lending. It's built on Proof-of-Work, on Bitcoin mining, which I will explain in later lessons. One thing is also true for Bitcoin: Greed is driving the adoption and the interest in Bitcoin. With interest, I mean that people want to have it, they want to use it, they want to learn about it. So greed is the common denominator between Ponzi, Fiat, and Bitcoin. But everything else is, to be honest, different. Actually, I would say the real Ponzi scheme is Fiat money creation.
