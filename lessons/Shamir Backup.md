## Transcript

There's something called a Shamir Backup. A Shamir Backup is a cryptographical method to split the seed into multiple parts. You can do it with a Trezor Model T. Trezor is basically the inventor of that technique, but it's a generally accepted and wellknown technique in the Bitcoin space. What does it do? 

Well, the Trezor Model T gives you the opportunity to create a cryptographically secure seed that is not in one part, but in two or three or four parts. That means the Trezor Model T will give you, for instance, three seeds. So you have Share 1, Share 2, Share 3, and these three you need to store them in separate places. And you will need only two out of three to recreate your single seed. That means you are more secure, because now you have three parts. And even in case of loss of one part, you still have the two parts to gain access to your single seed and to your funds. I think that's one of the best methods and the most secure methods to store your seed.
