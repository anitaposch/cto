## Transcript

Hello and welcome to my online course program that introduces you to Bitcoin and also gives you a deep view and a deep learning and understanding about self custody and how to stay private. Digital privacy is a big part of that course. These courses have several modules and several lessons where you can choose to learn more deep knowledge about Bitcoin, about self custody, for instance, how to set up a hardware wallet or how to acquire Bitcoin without KYC.  

First I need to have this short disclaimer here because the contents of this online course and my educational material, of course, do not constitute financial, tax or legal advice, but are for informational purposes only.  

The information is intended to inform a set of best, best practices. It may not address risks specific to your situation, and if it does not, you should modify appropriately. While this information may inform best practices, there's no guarantee that following this advice will sufficiently ensure the security of your digital assets. In addition, this information is only a window on best practices at the specific moment in time.  

Be aware that the Bitcoin ecosystem may have evolved and the risk assessment of specific products may have changed since the publication of this course. So, of course, I'm giving you the best practice I know at the moment of, but things change very quickly in this space. So please stay vigilant and aware of that.
