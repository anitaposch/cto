## Transcript

Another reason for people in authoritarian countries to use Bitcoin are foreign exchange controls. Foreign exchange controls basically control the import and export of national currency. And mostly countries with weak economies and flawed democracies use foreign exchange controls to limit what they call "speculation" against their weak currencies. Since authoritarian leaders want to limit and control people's possibilities to circumvent their oppressive systems, they apply regulations such as the following.

In Argentina, for instance, the capital controls only allow people to exchange a maximum amount of $200 per month from the Argentine peso to US dollars. And quite the same harsh regulations apply in Zimbabwe. If you run a business in Zimbabwe and need to import goods, you must ask the Reserve Bank for permission to send US dollars abroad. Here you can see one of the results of a foreign exchange auction in Zimbabwe. Once a week, businesses can apply at the Reserve Bank and say: "I need to import goods. I need US dollars." And then in that auction, the value and the price and the exchange rate from the Zimbabwean dollar to the US dollar are decided upon. So it's centrally controlled. And the US dollar funds are allocated, to the businesses who applied to receive the US dollars in exchange for their money. So, the thing is, those businesses they don't get the US dollars into their account. It's the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe that is paying on behalf of the businesses. So it's really a totally controlled system. And it's also clear that the real market value price of the national currency can never be found because it's a controlled system and not a free exchange of value. And also not a free market where the value of the currency is set by supply and demand, by the real needs of the economy. And that's how money is a system of control. It's there to control the people. It's there to control the inflows and outflows of their money. It's there to oppress people so that they don't even have the possibility to be a part of a global economy.
