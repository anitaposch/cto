## Setting up the Blue Wallet for ON-CHAIN bitcoin

This guide shows you how to install the Blue Wallet on your phone (Android and iOS). 

Blue Wallet is an open-source self-custodial Bitcoin wallet. You can receive, save and send bitcoin immediately after the set-up. No registration or email needed. 

Be sure to BACKUP your seed (12 words) offline. Do NOT copy the seed into your clipboard or make a digital copy or screenshot. 

If you need to switch to a different phone you install the app and then import the seed and your wallet with all your bitcoin is restored. 

## We will install the Phoenix wallet for Lightning payments later on
