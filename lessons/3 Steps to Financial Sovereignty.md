## Transcript

From the staircase to financial sovereignty. Now, we are going into the details, what that means. What are the steps to financial sovereignty? 

As said before, it's a lot of responsibility, yes, to hold your own keys, but you also have great freedom because no one can steal your money. No one can censor your bitcoin or freeze them or exchange it to just another currency, a valueless Zimbabwean dollar, for instance. So let's take a look at that staircase to financial sovereignty. What does this mean?

So well, on the ground floor, the first floor of this staircase, you still are a so-called what we call a Pre-coiner. So you're using your national currency. You've never owned bitcoin. You've never used it before. And still on that floor, people are, who have their money on exchanges like the bitcoin on Kraken, Coinbase, etc. You are on the "not your keys, not your coins" level. 

The next level is the second floor. That's the "your keys, your coins" floor, where you hold the seed to your bitcoin. You are in control of your money. It's really your bitcoin. And that is basically one of the steps where I want to take all the newbies of you so that you have your keys and you have your bitcoin in self-custody. 

And on top of that is the third floor, where you run your own Bitcoin node. And with that, you are becoming your own bank. You don't need to trust to trust anyone in the system anymore. Your node defines the rules that you are running. So you can decide which version of the Bitcoin software you want to run, and you are also verifying your own transactions. You are not depending on a block explorer, for instance, anymore, or on your wallet that shows you the amount of bitcoin you hold. So the third floor, the level of "your node, your rules" is at the moment for newbies or for people who are not so technically advanced, it's very difficult still to reach because you need to know a little bit about Linux and software and how to install that and things like that. But it will become easier over time. We already have systems where you can basically buy a small device and you can start running your own node, and in the future nodes will be on every device. So I'm sure that this will be the real, real, real total decentralized future of Bitcoin so that everyone can hold their own bitcoin in their wallets, and also verify that all transactions are correct and really in your possession.
