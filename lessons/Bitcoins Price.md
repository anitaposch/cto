## Transcript

Okay, let's talk about Bitcoin's price, basically, its market value. 

As said before in the volatility chapter, Bitcoin has huge price changes and people say therefore it's no store of value, it's not money because it's not a store of value. But if we look at that chart, we can see that basically Bitcoin was the best performing asset over the 10 years prior to 2021. And also the Bitcoin returns between 2010 and 2022: Yes, there are three years where we had a decline in the value of minus 58%, then 73%, and in 2022 (until the date of that chart was made), we had a decline of 65%. So it's true, but then we also have three years of huge gains in between. So as I said, view Bitcoin as a long-term investment. 

And of course there's never a guarantee that this performance will continue forever. So if anyone in the Bitcoin space promises you profits, then this person is a scam. I would never promise you anything or say it's sure that it'll go up. We don't know. But the price changes indicate something like that. 

And also, if you think about that: Bitcoin is a technology which has a real important use case. The more people who realize that that money really can help them in their daily lives will use it. And that's the network effect in the Bitcoin network. It's like everyone realizes: "Wow, Facebook is cool. I'm now using Facebook to communicate" or "WhatsApp is great. I'm now using WhatsApp to communicate", "Bitcoin is great. I'm using it because it can't be censored". And these stories will flow from one person to the other. And that's the network effect of Bitcoin. And that is then also why the value of Bitcoin as a technology and an investment and money will go up. I mean, if people make negative experiences with it, yes, then they maybe will stop using it and then the value will go down. But the history has shown us different developments. 

The current last all time high, as we call it in Bitcoin, was in November, 2021 when it reached a value of $69,000. So one bitcoin had that price. Recently, it went up a little bit, in between, we went down to $13,000 per bitcoin, and now we are about like $27,000. And that's the chart of the price since 2009. And we, you look at the same chart, but just in a different interpretation, that's on a logarithmic scale, then actually we see that the price has always been going up with small declines in between. So the logarithmic price scale shows us the difference in percentage points and not in dollar prices.
