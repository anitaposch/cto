And then there is another argument that's often used against the use of Bitcoin, or let's say the skeptics use it. They say, if you don't have internet, you can't use Bitcoin. Therefore, Bitcoin is useless because many people in these developing countries, or also if you don't have access in Europe to the internet, you can't use it. That's wrong. 

As you can see in the following video, there are already solutions that tackle that problem. There is a South African young developer who developed a solution called Machankura, and it facilitates regular phones, so you don't even need to have a smartphone to be able to send, receive, and own Bitcoin. As you can see in that video, one is using the Machankura system with with so-called USSD codes. That's basically the technology that millions of people in African countries are using for mobile money. They are sending mobile money among each other via text messages. And in that video you can see how this works and these feature phones run on the telecom providers network. So, you don't really need the internet to use Bitcoin. Of course, this is an evolving new technology, and it's not very widespread used yet, but it goes to show that there will be solutions to that problem. And at the same time, the internet will be spread out into more and more regions. It's also not true because there were already people who were sending Bitcoin over radio. So meaning, there's one guy who sent Bitcoin from Canada to the US via radio. Also, of course no one would use that now, but these technologies can grow. 

Also, we have couple of satellites that are basically broadcasting the Bitcoin blockchain to earth. So, you only need to have a regular satellite dish. If you connect it with the right software, you can receive the Bitcoin blockchain and all its transactions from satellites. That's a project by Blockstream. The CEO of Blockstream is the guy I showed you before, Adam Back, who some people believe is Satoshi Nakamoto. So there will be more and more technologies that enable us to use Bitcoin. And at the same time, the use of the internet or the adoption of the internet won't stop. I mean, they are the first countries now in Africa where Elon Musk's starlink is working and people are getting those satellite dishes also into Zimbabwe, where the internet is really very, very bad and very expensive at the same time. And just imagine if all African people at the same time, I mean it won't be at the same time, but when they are getting access to that much cheaper and much more reliable internet, then we will see an explosion of innovation and an explosion of use of the internet. And I think also of Bitcoin.
