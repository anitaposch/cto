## Transcript

So now that you are deeper into Bitcoin, and you have an understanding of how a wallet works, and you might already have a wallet on your phone, we are getting into the part how to obtain and acquire bitcoin. And first we need to talk about Bitcoin's price again. 

There's this meme showing us a dog that's sitting in a house on fire, looking at the cup with a sticker that says "One bitcoin is one bitcoin". And that's the thing to remember. When the price of bitcoin drops and you might panic because your funds are melting away, you are still owning the amount of bitcoin that you've owned before. So in bitcoin, your property, your funds basically, stay the same. It only changes in the value in your national currency. That's sometimes a good thing to remember when the price is going down. I mean, the same applies, of course, when the value of bitcoin is going up. But then mostly it's a reason for joy and not to panic. So that's also the reason: always think long term, think three years, think five years from now. Only exchange as much into bitcoin as you can afford to not have in the next three to five years, because then the phases when the roller coaster goes down and up and down will not hurt you that much. 

So how is the price of bitcoin derived? Who is deciding on the price of bitcoin? Well, there is no universal price for bitcoin, and no one is setting the price of bitcoin. The value of bitcoin is found in an open market, in a free market, where demand and supply determine the price. And every exchange has its own order book, and there the price can be found. So basically, the exchanges find their current value that they display on their websites of one bitcoin. Because people are buying and selling bitcoin and in those trades, they show how much they are willing to bid, like to pay for a bitcoin, or how much they want to receive in return for a bitcoin. And that's an order book that you can see where trades are finding their price equilibrium. And from that, always the current value and the current price of bitcoin is derived. 

If you look up the exchange rate for bitcoin in different countries, you will find differences between the nations. For instance, buying bitcoin in Zimbabwe with local currency will always be more expensive than with US dollars. That's not because bitcoin is more expensive in a way in Zimbabwe, but because the demand for the local currency is lower. you can't move your Zimbabwe dollar out of the country. I mean, you can, but no one will accept it. Even Zimbabweans prefer to hold US dollars. So, people will need to pay a premium to buy bitcoin when they use a lower valued currency. 

There are all time high trackers, like this one that you can find at anita.link/ath. And those trackers show you the drawdown in percent from the last all time high. It's just an interesting view on things, if you want to look it up. 

And then, of course, it's often complicated. I mean, calculating in your head how much value a bitcoin, or a part of a bitcoin, a satoshi, for instance, has in your local currency. It is not really doable in the head. So there are websites like this one that show you how much a certain amount of bitcoin is in your local currency. So, for instance, is one that's called satstofiat.africa with some African currencies. Or there's this one, it's called xsats. You can find it at anita.link/calc. You can enter an amount of satoshis or bitcoin, and then the value in US dollars is shown to.
