## Transcript

How do these peer-to-peer non-custodial trading platforms work? It's a technical platform with which two people can exchange national currency to bitcoin without any intermediaries. The intermediary is basically the platform, the program, the code, which puts the money, the bitcoin in escrow so that no one can steal from each other. And you also have to pay a security deposit to the platform so that you don't cheat. 

So for instance, if Alice wants to buy, let's say a bitcoin, she opens a buy offer on the peer-to-peer offer book on the platform. Bob wants to sell a bitcoin and sees Alice's offer. He takes the offer from the order book, and then he publishes a deposit transaction. Alice sees that Bob wants to sell her a bitcoin, so she transfers the fiat money into Bob's bank account and Bob then checks his bank account. He sees he has received the fiat money and he confirms that he has received the money. And that then starts the exchange, meaning the Bitcoin network releases the bitcoin to Alice and the platform, the non-custodial trading platform, is sending also the security deposit back to Alice and also Bob gets back his security deposit and the trade is done, which are examples of peer-to-peer non-custodial trading platforms. 

Well, there's AgoraDesk. AgoraDesk runs over TOR, but it's a centralized platform, so there is still a company behind that and you need to set up an account. Then there's RoboSats. It also runs over TOR, but is still a centralized company, but you don't need to have an account there. You can create a robot basically. Then Hodl Hodl. HodlHodl.com also is a centralized platform where you need to set up an account, but still everything works without KYC. Then Bisque. Bisque is actually a true decentralized platform because you really need to download the bisque software and install it on your computer. So it's really completely decentralized. And in that sense, it's the safest and most decentralized platform where you can exchange fiat money, your national currency into bitcoin. And you do that really from person to person. So, you go there and you check which payment methods are offered by the other person, and does it come at the price that I want to pay? As you know, "KYC-free bitcoin" cost a little bit more than "KYC bitcoin". That's for me something I'm willing to pay because then I have KYC free and privacy protection basically with my coins. Then there is Peach Bitcoin, but as far as I've seen, it's still in beta mode. It's a centralized solution. It should be very easy to use. And if you're staying under a certain threshold, it works without KYC. And then I've heard of Noones App, but it's still in beta mode. I've never seen it. I didn't use it. It's a ccentralized exchange, but you also can exchange money under a certain threshold without KYC as an example. I just want to show you how RoboSats is looking. So you see here basically the offer book with different payment methods, different currencies, and then you can see the price at which one is willing to exchange bitcoin to US dollars or to Euro.
