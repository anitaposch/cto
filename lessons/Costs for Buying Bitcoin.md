## Transcript

Last but not least, let's not forget that there are of course costs for buying bitcoin. 

1. First, the market price of bitcoin, which basically sets how many bitcoin or satoshis you can buy with a certain amount of your national currency.
2. Then many platforms or all platforms will have trading fees for their service. You really need to do your own research there because those trading and transaction fees are different on every platform.
3. Then you have the Bitcoin transaction fee to mine your transaction, which may or may not be included in the trading fee of the platform.
  
As I said before, bitcoin that are non-KYC and are not registered are more expensive usually. So before you acquire bitcoin, always check the trading fees and the fees on the different platforms, because there are huge differences. And as I said before, especially with Bitcoin ATMs, sometimes they don't really show you how much their fees are, but you really need to make sure because otherwise you might have a big surprise in the end.
