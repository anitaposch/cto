## Transcript

Some wallets, especially those which are also using the Lightning Network, are asking you to back up the seed phrase in the Cloud additionally, or just in the Cloud. This is most of the times a technical requirement because Lightning needs to be connected to the internet at the moment to send and receive funds. So it's convenient maybe. For smaller funds, I also think it's okay. But if a hardware wallet would allow you to just store a seed on a drive or on a Dropbox, I wouldn't do that. So too much internet involved, I would never do that.
