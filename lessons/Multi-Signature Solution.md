## Transcript

If your Bitcoin funds reach an amount where you think, okay, wow, I need something really secure, either I suggest you do a Shamir backup, or other people will tell you to set up a Multi-Signature solution. A Multi-Sig is where more than one key or one seed is needed to authorize a Bitcoin transaction. While with a Single-Sig solution, you are the only person who is responsible for the backup. You are also the only person who is needed to send Bitcoin from your wallet. In a Multi-Signature setup, you can divide the responsibilities for the possession of your Bitcoin, but you also need all keys to sign a transaction. 

For instance, you can set up a two of three solution where you need two keys to sign a transaction. That means it's not only you on your single hardware wallet that is pressing keys to send a transaction. There also needs to be a second wallet and the third wallet either with other people or you yourself have a second or a third wallet where you then also press the keys on the next wallet so that you have the signatures of two out of three wallets to send a transaction. 

That's a setup that really makes sense in a business context. So for instance, if you are in a bigger organization and the organization has Bitcoin funds, then you need (it's like you need it now already in a organizational setup) more people to sign on a budget or to send a payment. That's the same here with this Multi-Sig solution. Then two out of three people like the CEO, the CFO and the C00 of a company would need to sign a transaction to send it somewhere else. But the technical setup of a Multi-Signature solution is technically complex and for advanced users only. 

I don't use Multi-Signature. I think it's something that really exceeds even my knowledge at that moment, and I don't want to put myself at that risk. I find a Shamir backup much better or to store a single seed in different locations. Don't make it too complex. It might exceed your own technical capabilities. As I said before, most people lose access to their funds. It's not that they are being robbed at home or something like that. They make it too complex even for themselves. And then think of your heirs and of your family because they might not even know what a Multi-Sig is. So how do you want to explain to them when in case, and that happens from time to time, you die, you get ill or something like that, and then your heirs and your family will not be able to access your funds as an alternative. If you are a business or you really have so many funds that you really don't want to be responsible yourself alone, then I suggest you use the service of companies like CASA or Unchained Capital. They are industry leading Multi-Sig solutions. They offer you help while setting up these backup solutions where you are retaining self-custody. Those solutions, of course, have a price. As far as I know, it's subscription models, so you pay a monthly price for their service. But for some of you, this might be the right setup.
