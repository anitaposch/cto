## Transcript

Another argument by many people is that Bitcoin will fail. Bitcoin will fail like the first internet companies did. 

So it's a paradigm shift at the moment. I'm actually a digital native in a Generation X body. I can remember life without the internet, even without the VCR or a telephone. Like the first 12 years of my life my parents didn't have a landline telephone. We only had one TV station in Austria. And with 14, that was 1984, I used my first computer. And in 1997, I installed my first internet connection at home and email. I got my first email. And at that same year, there were only 1 million websites globally, and Google and Amazon didn't even exist internationally. 

And also, as you can see here, in 1995, an astronomer and author named Clifford Stoll wrote an article for the Newsweek titled "The Internet? Bah!" And basically he dismissed the internet as a trend that would go away again. And today we know that the opposite is true. It's the most used technology around the world, and it connects us all. 

And also there was the Dot-Com bubble around 2000 where a lot of money was put into venture capital investments. And in 2000, the big bubble burst because basically everyone thought that every website will be a huge business. And so everyone put their money in it. But the technology and the innovation behind was not there. So investors were throwing money into IPOs and funding. The NASDAQ index hit an all time high. And by the late 1990s, a bubble of overvalued tech companies was formed. After millions of funding over the years, there was no sign of profitability in these Dot-Com companies, mainly because they never had any strategy to build a profitable product. The investors realized their mistake. And it's very interesting, in the year 2000, I mentioned Michael Saylor before, March a popular software company called MicroStrategy - Yes, we are talking about the one of Michael Saylor - announced bankruptcy. And after that, in April, Microsoft lost the lawsuit against the US government and was found guilty of using monopolistic practices. And since Microsoft was dominating the PC industry at this time, and Microsoft was valued above 500 billion, as soon as the biggest player in the market started losing value, everybody lost their sanity. And all of the Dot-Com companies started losing valuation. And then the attack of September 11th, 2001 completely destroyed the NASDAQ Stock Exchange. By this time, the global market had lost 5 trillion US dollars in total valuation. 

And that's also why many people say Bitcoin is old technology. It will fail or it has failed, whatever. And also all the funky new cryptocurrencies are the way to go. I'm more like a traditional person. I believe in security, safety and a sort of a long-term thinking in the development of the Bitcoin blockchain and the software, which is the idea behind Bitcoin. And go fast and break things is definitely not the thing you want to have in your money, in Bitcoin. So that's why I'm more going for slow development and security. 

And then in December, 2000, after the whole Dot-Com crash, there was an article, for instance, in the Daily Mail in the UK saying "The internet may be just a passing fad as millions give up on it". And today, the most valuable brands are Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft, so internet companies. And we can also see the adoption of the internet compared to the world population, for instance. The internet started around 1990 to be globally used. And in 2000, you see where the numbers of users are. It's almost like with Bitcoin. So one could say today we are about in the year 1997 compared to the internet development. And so we are really, really very early still. And if you start learning about Bitcoin now, you are still an early adopter.
