Another opportunity are Bitcoin vouchers, from Azte.co for instance. Or in Austria, there's a company that's called BitcoinBon. You basically can go into a shop, buy a voucher with your national currency in cash, and then you can redeem the code that is shown on the voucher on the website of the service provider and then redeem Bitcoin. So basically that's a great way to, for instance, send Bitcoin from South Africa to Zimbabwe, because in Zimbabwe, no one can obtain Bitcoin on an exchange. So if you have relatives in South Africa, then you could ask them to buy a voucher with South African Rand and then send you the code that is printed on the voucher. Then in Zimbabwe, you open the website of Azte.co. You put in the voucher code and you can use your own wallet to redeem the Bitcoin to your wallet. And it's also KYC free. Then there's a possibility to use gift gift cards to obtain Bitcoin. For instance, there is this website called Coin Cola. On Coin Cola, you can use Amazon gift cards, American Express gift card, Apple Store gift cards, Google Play gift cards, etc. to get Bitcoin. It works without KYC, but I guess that the fees will be rather high, but it's an opportunity.
