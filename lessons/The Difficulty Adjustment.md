## Transcript

The difficulty of the mining calculations is set every 2016 blocks, meaning if there are more miners who have more computers, more hashing capacities in the network, the mining difficulty goes up automatically, and if miners are dropping out of the system, the hash rate and the mining difficulty go down. That means the goal for that is to have always these 10 minutes of block time. Every 10 minutes a block is mined. If there are many machines in the system, the difficulty goes up so that the 10 minutes stay. If there are less machines in the system, so the hashing capacity is lower, then the difficulty goes down again, so that we again have the time of 10 minutes. So that the machines are able to mine a block every 10 minutes.
