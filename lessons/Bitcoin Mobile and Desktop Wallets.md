## Transcript

Let's talk about wallet recommendations I have for you for your smartphone. And I'm talking only about two wallets here because these are the two I'm using myself. There are so many wallets out there and every day new wallets are coming to that that I can't test all of them. And it's critical actually to have wallets which are trusted, which are open-sourced, meaning everyone can read the source code. A lot of the wallets that are around are closed-source, so nobody really knows how the code is looking. No one can evaluate if there are bugs in it or not. So I recommend as mobile wallets for your smartphone, the Blue Wallet and the Blockstream Green Wallet. It's funny, it's a coincidence that they are both called after a colour, but that doesn't mean anything other than that. 

Then those two you can also use on your desktop. But as I said before, I prefer to use those wallets on my mobile devices because, in general, mobile devices are more secure than your Windows PC or even your Mac, although a Mac usually is more secure than a Windows PC. So I only use desktop wallets if I connect it together to my hardware wallet instead of the manufacturer software or if I want to see more wallets in one software, then I use the Sparrow wallet for the desktop. I can connect hardware wallets to it. I can also connect my wallets that I have on BTCpay server with it. Sparrow is a very versatile bitcoin on-chain wallet. Electrum is also a great wallet. It was one of the first self-custody wallets on the market and I'd say it's more for tech savvy users.
