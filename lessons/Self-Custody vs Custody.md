Okay, now let's get into the weeds of how you can climb the staircase to financial sovereignty. What is this? 12 English words? Well, that's Bitcoin. So if you hold Bitcoin by yourself, that's a so-called seed phrase. If you have the seed phrase to your Bitcoin wallet, you are the sole owner of your Bitcoin. No one can take it away from you. No one can freeze your bank account because you don't have a bank account, and you can also not freeze your Bitcoin. These 12 words can hold your life savings. That's why Bitcoin is so special. And that is what we call self-custody. 

Self-custody is your keys, your coins. Bitcoin's primary strength is that it's uncensorable, which gives you financial sovereignty. That is besides the fixed 21 million supply and the fact that no one can stop Bitcoin, the main differentiator to all other forms of money. It protects you from bail ins like in Cyprus in 2014. And from monetary inflation, which is devaluing funds. It ends the enforced financialization of your money through banking and financial products. It gives you full control over your funds, enables you to move globally while bringing your money with you. It's an alternative and opt-out of the feared system. 

And all you need are 12 English words, your seed phrase. If you do not have a seed phrase, you do not have the privileges and the freedom stated above. What you have is your Bitcoin are in custody. We have the saying, not your keys, not your coins. And that is when you have your Bitcoin on exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, Luno, Yellow Card, BitStamp, and what all their names are. If you have Bitcoin on an exchange like that, you don't own your Bitcoin. It's basically like a bank account. Many people find that better because they think self-custody is a risk. It's too much responsibility, but I mean, the illusion that money in the bank is safer than money under the mattress is very much a position of privilege as Andreas Antonopoulos has been saying, because that's an illusion that people in western countries have. But people in the global south, they distrust banks anyhow because of their experiences. So self-custody of funds is very, very important for people everywhere actually. And once you have learned and executed the steps to financial freedom that we will go through in the next lessons, you will see that it's not as difficult as it may seem first.
