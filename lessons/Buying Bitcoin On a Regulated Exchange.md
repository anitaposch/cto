## Transcript

And then of course, if you don't want to do that or it's not possible to get no KYC bitcoin, you can still use custodial exchanges that are regulated and therefore record your transactions and tie your identity to the bitcoin you own. And mostly people's first interaction with cryptocurrencies is through custodial exchanges like you see them here: Binance, Coinbase, Luno, Kraken, Yellow Card, Bitstamp, just to name a few. 

They are called custodial because they possess the keys to your bitcoin. You do get a wallet on these platforms, but it's more like a bank account leading to counterparty risks such as hacking, seizure, or confiscation of your bitcoin by government. Trading on these exchanges is done off-chain, meaning that the transactions are not settled on the blockchain, but are only managed inside the platform databases. This increases the speed of transactions, but at the same time, it leads to a lack of transparency and security. To acquire bitcoin in a custodial fashion, you need to open an account, comply with KYC and AML registration processes, and then deposit fiat money into the platform's account. After your money has arrived on the bank account of the exchange, you can trade it for bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. To mitigate the risks of third parties, you should always take the money immediately, take the exchanged bitcoin and transfer it to your own wallet where you have to seed. So basically it's like doing a dirty job, do it very fast. 

I'm also using Kraken, for instance, because sometimes I need to exchange my bitcoin into euros because, of course, still in Austria most people are using euros and I like to use cash to be honest, to maintain my privacy. In my early Bitcoiner days, I of course also didn't earn bitcoin, so I had to exchange it from euros to bitcoin on a regulated exchange also because I didn't know better back then. And so as soon as I exchanged my euros to bitcoin, I always withdrew it immediately to my own self-custody wallet because I never wanted to have the risk of a custodial exchange. And also I understand that Bitcoin's basic idea is being without intermediaries. So why should I open and leave my bitcoin in an exchange account when it's the same as a bank account? It just doesn't make sense to me. And I guess by now, since you've heard all the lessons before, you also understand why it's important to have self-custody. But don't forget, after using a regulated exchange where you identified yourself, your bitcoin are basically registered and are tied to your identity. So I always used a bitcoin broker. In Austria, that's Coinfinity, for instance. A bitcoin broker is also regulated, but they send the bitcoin directly to you. They are never holding your bitcoin, so that's a middle way in a sense. So basically you need to KYC, but the platform never holds your bitcoin. So basically you don't have that third party risk that they are holding your coins because they immediately send it to you after you purchased.
