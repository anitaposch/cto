## Transcript

Hello. In this lesson, we are going to look at the question of how money is actually being created in today's world, and I want to start with a quote from Satoshi Nakamoto, who described that very well: "The Central Bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust."

Learning about Bitcoin was an eye-opener for me. I read that quote back then and I didn't understand what was meant with it. There are two distinct periods of my life, one before Bitcoin and one after Bitcoin. I see things completely differently today. In my goal, to understand Bitcoin, I first had to understand the current monetary system. What are the differences between currency systems like the US Dollar or the Euro, or Bitcoin? What's inflation? What is the role that our central banks play? It's puzzling that we don't learn these concepts in school, but this specific lack of education may, unfortunately, be intentional.

That's why after completing this course, you will have an understanding of the differences between the traditional system and Bitcoin. So if you don't understand these concepts at the first moment, I feel you, because it took me years to understand how everything works. And in the Bitcoin space, I'm still learning something new every day. 

At the moment, 180 different currencies are used in 195 countries around the world. A currency is a system of money in common use defined by governments. Many jurisdictions defined a national currency as a legal tender, which makes it declared by law, valid for payment of debts and it cannot be refused as a method of payment. All 180 currencies, the US dollar, the euro, the yuan, the pound sterling, for example, can be defined as being within a category called Fiat money. Since 1971, none of these feared currencies has been backed by gold or by any other tangible asset. Money only has value because we believe in it. Money is a language to express how valuable something is. The word "fiat" stems from Latin and means let it be done. So current money is created through an entry in a digital ledger and is just a number in an accounting system. There is no creation of real-world productivity behind it. And who is in charge of the creation of money? It's a mix of governments, central banks, together with commercial banks. 

It's a centralized hierarchical system with gatekeepers. There is no agreement on a supply limit or an emission rate. Fiat is money by decree. It's coercively managed through the state's implicit threat of violence. We have to say it like it is. The value is being maintained by the creation of an endless tax liability that you can only satisfy with Fiat money, with that legal tender and by state-administered security markets as well as legal tender laws and tax policy. So how is money now created? Money is created by central banks in the form of paper, money, and coins. Central banks buy assets and bonds from the open market. Money flows into the system. Money is also created through government stimulus, through benefits, grants, and bailouts. Money is created by commercial banks through loans and you will learn why that is that way in the following chapters. You will learn, why your savings are a liability and your loans are an asset for a bank, which is quite weird I think.
