## Transcript

Another method, of course, as we spoke before, are Bitcoin ATMs, where up to a certain threshold in some countries you can exchange national currency to bitcoin without KYC. But you need to take care. Sometimes the transaction costs, like the fees that the Bitcoin ATM providers put on top of the Bitcoin transaction fees, they are sometimes very, very high. So if you need to identify yourself anyhow, then you can go to an exchange like Kraken, for instance, where the fees are much less than at certain Bitcoin ATMs. It only a good deal to use a Bitcoin ATM when you can do it without KYC. You can find Bitcoin ATMs on several websites. I just want to tell you, they are not always up to date , like for instance, in Zimbabwe.
