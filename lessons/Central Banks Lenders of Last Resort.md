## Transcript

The next lesson is about central banks as lenders of last resort. In the last lesson, we were talking about the fractional reserve banking system and how unstable that actually all is. And now let's talk about central banks. What does this means? They are so-called lenders of last resource.

Commercial banks can and have called for the help of the Central Bank as a lender of last resort many times. In 2008, 2009, the banks who were actually responsible for the global financial crisis received a bailout money. They were rescued because they were too big to fail. And what did they do with that money? History shows they bought back shares in their own companies. Nothing trickled down into the economy and to the regular people. The gap between rich and poor inevitably became bigger and bigger because it's always the people who already have assets that can get a cheap loan and they have a bailout in the end from a central bank. So the risk is always there to put money into risky investment schemes. That's why central banks are called lenders of last resort. 

The objective is to prevent economic disruption as a result of financial panics and bank runs spreading from one bank to the next due to a lack of liquidity. And that is what we've shown you before with the fractional reserve banking system. Financial actors like banks know that the central banks will have to bail them out, which leads to moral hazard, excessive risk taking by both bankers and investors. 

The creation of artificial money through central banks overshadowed the distortion in the market because of the flooding and manipulation of the monetary system with cheap money, there is no rational price finding mechanism anymore. Usually supply and demand determine the value of goods and commodities, but in a distorted and manipulated market, there is no room for a fair price discovery. The global middle class is paying for the financial elite's greed, which in turn is being fed by a corrupted system of money creation. 

Have you as an individual ever been bailed out? I haven't. And if you have, would you do the same thing over and over again? Rigging the system knowing that there is a last resort which will always bail you out? This is exactly what banks, wall Street hedge funds and their lobbying lawyers are doing constantly assisted by central banks all over the world. Classically, central banks hold reserves in case of emergencies, set interest rates, and allocate funds to stimulate or slow economies after disruptive events like panics or wars. 

The more recent role they have assumed is one of securing the entire financial system and influencing the economic trajectory of entire sovereign nations. This is the antithesis of democratic rule. Such a monetary oligarchy operates beyond democratic norms and limits, says Nomi Prins in her book Collusion from 2019. Nomi Prins tapped into the PS psyche of Wall Street, revealing how the very structure of the financial system hinged on traders flocking to the next big bet, regardless of the stakes. In addition, the same people and families kept popping up cycling through Wall Street and Washington. They influenced the economy beneath them from their loftier hates of status, private money and public office, dismantling laws that stood in their way and finding loopholes through others. According to Nomi Prins, private banks normalized market manipulation and central banks made it an art form.
