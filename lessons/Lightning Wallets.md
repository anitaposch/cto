## Transcript

Now let's take a look at Lightning Wallets. There the same rule applies: best is to have a self-custody wallet. A wallet that is basically like a node on your phone. Lightning works differently than Bitcoin on-chain, but there are also so-called self-custody wallets and custodial wallets in Lightning. 

I made an extensive test of self-custody wallets when I was in Zimbabwe, on the outside, on the countryside, where the internet is really, really bad and very slow. And I came to the conclusion that the Phoenix Wallet is a self-custody mobile Lightning wallet, which means you're basically having a Lightning node running on your phone. And so you are always in possession of your bitcoin, your Lightning bitcoin. It even worked in that bad circumstances with the very, very slow internet. 

Then there is the Breez Wallet. I like the Breez Wallet very much because it's not only a Lightning wallet, a Lightning node on your phone. It's also a podcast player and point of sale tool. This means that if you have a small shop or a restaurant, you can use the Breeze wallet. You can put some products in there with their prices, and then if a customer comes and buys something from you, you can present them the product on the device. Let the person pay. The problem with the Breez Wallet back then was in Zimbabwe that it didn't work in these hard circumstances. So in areas where you have great internet, it will always work. But there it was a problem. But I guess that maybe next year, if I do the test again, I will see or I hope that the Breeze Wallet is also working there. 

Another option, of course, are custody wallets also with Lightning bitcoin. I don't really recommend them, but there are circumstances where it's good to use them because they also have some privacy upsides actually. But on the other hand, never leave too many funds on a custodial wallet. That applies for bitcoin on-chain as well as for Lightning bitcoin. One of the easiest wallets is the Wallet of Satoshi. Then there is the Coinos Wallet, which is a desktop wallet, and it can also be used as a point of sale. 

And then I recommend Alby because Alby is working together with us on the BTC podcasting platform, where people can host their podcast for free and at the same time immediately receive bitcoin, Lightning bitcoin satoshis that are streamed from a podcast player like the Breeze Wallet to the host. And therefore we are using Getalby. On Getalby, you can also create your own Lightning address. A Lightning address is basically, it looks like an email address, but it's for Bitcoin and you can also do that in the Wallet of Satoshi. 

But still, I definitely prefer self-custody wallets. So that means I prefer the Phoenix Wallet or the Breez Wallet. And I will also show you how to set that up in one of the other lessons.
