## Transcript

So, now let's talk about the loads and loads of arguments against Bitcoin. 

A lot of people will tell you why you should not use buy, acquire, earn, whatever, Bitcoin. So I would advise you to only start using Bitcoin and investing in it or saving it when you really are sure that you want to try it. Only invest as much of your money in bitcoin as you understand and are comfort comfortable to. Only as much as you are willing to lose in the worst case scenario because the more you get to know and use Bitcoin, the more trust you will build. 

I mean, I research the topic now for over like seven years, I think. But when I started in my first year in 2017, I needed three months until I was so sure that I want to try that, that I bought bitcoin for 75 euros and that was at the price when bitcoin, I think was 2,100 euros. So I also waited very long because I wanted to be sure that that's really a thing and not a scam. And also I didn't want to make a mistake. 

So I would give you the advice to start small, start practicing with little amounts, and from that steps on, you will build trust.
