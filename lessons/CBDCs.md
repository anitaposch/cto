## Transcript

Central banks all over the world are working on so-called CBDCs, Central Bank Digital Currencies. They want to build something like Bitcoin, but of course they can't make it open source. They can't make it neutral. They need a centralized bank or a centralized institution that is deciding on the amount of money that's being created and so on. 

So basically, CBDCs are the new panopticon. Why is that? Well, think about the general person who tells me: "I've got nothing to hide. I'm okay with me being surveilled on the internet because it's not a problem. A CBDC and no cash is basically very convenient. I like it." That's a few that's completely focused on convenience. But what are we forgetting here? 

Well, in a CBDC, every single payment will be tracked. There's absolutely no anonymity, although they will tell you it's private and we take care of your anonymity, but you don't know if it's true because it's closed to us. No anonymity means no privacy at all. Everyone in the central bank, everyone who's working on those databases will be able to see what you're doing and where you're spending your money on. The next step then will be social credit scores, as we all already see it in China with their program, where, if you don't behave correctly like the big party wants you to do, then they restrict you. You're not able to buy a ticket for a train, for instance, or for a flight and things like that. They try to influence your decisions by cutting you off from money and cutting you off from possibilities. 

The next thing which will be possible with CBDC is automatic tax deduction. So up until now, I have to make my tax papers, and then I'm paying my taxes to the tax authorities. Well, with the CBDC, basically they can immediately deduct the taxes from your income. They can add value added tax. They can change these value added tax amounts within a second, actually. 

Next thing is, there's of course a huge risk of data breaches and hacks. All your data, all your transactions will be available to the public online, and hackers are not going to do nice things with it. 

And at the same time, the banks and the central authorities have absolute control over everything every single one of us is doing. The access to our money can be cut off or limited in a second. And you know that there are many, many mistakes are being made in those things. 

And also, I mean, today your government and your central bankers might be nice people. They might do what you like them to do and you trust them. But the next day, after the next election, the other party could be in power. The other people who you don't trust could be in power. And then this is a tool which will be used against you as it's now used against people who are trying to topple dictators and authoritarian countries. So money is definitely a system of control. 

And also the central banks can with a CBDC inflate money supply instantly so they can really change everything in a moment. 

A CBDC is not about freedom or individual rights or privacy. It's pure control masquerading as a safer payment system with faster transnational currency settlement.
