## Transcript

Bitcoin is money. Whereas in the textbook definition, Bitcoin is not money. Why? The textbook definition of money says that it has to be a store of value. So the value must remain stable over time. It must be a medium of exchange. It's widely accepted in exchange for goods and services. And it's a medium of account. It is used as a measure for prices, costs and profits. That textbook definition was defined by a guy called William Stanley Jevons in 1875. And this analysis was becoming so widely popular that all textbooks are using that definition of money. 

And it's true that Bitcoin actually doesn't fulfill that. And that such it would not be money because for most people it's not a store of value. Most people don't use it as a medium of exchange and also not as a medium of account. But that is because the other currency, the national currency, is legal tender. So it's the money by law, by legislation, but not because it evolved as such. Whereas Bitcoin is evolving as a new form of money, which is not forced upon us. It's an opt-in. And that form of money which is really being created by itself and by the network effect, it has to go through certain stages. 

First, it has to become a store of value. Then trust has to be built. Then people will use it as a medium of exchange. And only then it will be used as a medium of account. Dismissing Bitcoin because it does not yet fulfill all the functions of money at the moment is missing the point. 

And there we also have a comparison, comparison of the traits of money. This was done by a guy called Ryan Walker in 2014 already, and he took the concepts of Darwin's theory of natural selection to compare the evolution of the different forms of money. So the table shows you the degree to which gold, fiat, and bitcoin fulfilled the traditionally recognized traits of money. So let's walk through that shortly. So the different traits of money are:
- **Fungible**: It has to be fungible and interchangeable with each other. Gold, fiat money and bitcoin is highly fungible.
- **Non-consumable**: So we shouldn't eat it. We shouldn't be able to eat it. No, it shouldn't go away, you know? So that's all high for all the forms of money.
- **Portability**: Yeah. I mean, for gold portability is moderate because you can't just go with a brick of gold around and it's heavy. And fiat money is better because you can do online banking and things like that.
- **Durable**: It needs to be durable. Yes, gold is highly durable, but I mean, fiat money bank notes, they are not very durable. Whereas bitcoin has high durability.
- **Highly divisible**: Yeah. Gold. Hmm. Yes, you can have small gold coins, but other than that? While bitcoin, we have very, very small units of bitcoin.
- **Secure**: It should not be able to be counterfeited. Well, you can counterfeit gold, you can counterfeit fiat currency, but you cannot forge bitcoin.
-  **Easily transactable**: Well, gold, not so much, fiat high. Bitcoin also high.
-  **Scarce**: It should be scars where the supply is predictable. Yes, gold. Moderately because there is a certain amount of gold, but we don't know how much there will be in the future. Fiat money is definitely not scarce as we've seen in the chapters about monetary money supply inflation, and Ponzi schemes. Bitcoin is very scarce because we only will have 21 million bitcoin ever.

And then these three rows are basically new because that's what bitcoin is, what hasn't been there before. 

- **Government issued**: Gold is not issued by governments, but fiat money is. Bitcoin is not.
- **Decentralization**: So gold is definitely not decentralized. And fiat money also is not decentralized created.
- **Programmability**: Gold is not programmable. Fiat is not programmable. But Bitcoin is.
