## Transcript

Let's talk about cold storage. Also known as hardware wallets. They are also to self-custody your bitcoin in a very, very, very secure way. There are many manufacturers out there and as with software wallets, every day new hardware wallet manufacturers are coming to the market with new products. And here it's the same. I'm recommend those I have used myself and that have built a lot of trust in recent years in the market. 

So for instance, there's the BitBox02. I can show you one here I like the BitBox02 because it really looks like a USB stick and you can connect it to your computer or directly with your phone. And what I like is that it really looks like a USB stick, which makes it great to travel with because if anyone at a border or customs would ask me what that is, I just would say it's a USB stick, which is actually true. It just signs my keys and my transactions for my Bitcoin transactions. 

And then another manufacturer and I think they were the first company who really came out with hardware wallets is Trezor from Prague. That's a Trezor Model T. That's the luxury version of the Trezors. You can start smaller with a Trezor One. All good devices. 

Then the Coldcard from Coinkite is more for the nerds, I'd say. And it looks like a calculator. 

And then from Ledger from France is Nanos and Nano X, both devices which are definitely good devices. But I lost a little bit my trust in Ledger since they flossed their marketing database two times, meaning someone hacked it and all the customer marketing data was published on the Internet. I was one of those unlucky customers. And that's why I always say, don't use your real address or your residence as a shipping address for hardware devices. Since then, I'm not a fan so much of Ledger anymore, but I mean the devices are definitely good. 

And last but not least, it's not on the slide yet. I can recommend Blockstream's Jade Wallet. 

Regarding security with hardware wallets, never ever buy a hardware wallet on eBay or from someone else, basically secondhand. Always go to the manufacturer's website or the manufacturer's Amazon site and buy there because otherwise someone could have tampered with the device. You never know. Speaking of tamper evident, all those manufacturers have packaging that will show you that someone has opened it. So for instance here, the BitBox02, you can see it's a plastic bag. If you open it up, you would see that someone opened it. Same goes for Trezor. Trezor is packaged like that, like the Model One. And you can see on the top here there's another plastic strip. If you rip that off, basically the whole packaging is ripped apart. And so you can see that someone has opened it already.
