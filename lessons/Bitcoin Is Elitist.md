The next criticism and argument against using Bitcoin is that Bitcoin is elitst. It's only for the rich. Not everyone will be able to have bitcoin. 

Well, there are small denominations of bitcoin. You don't need to buy a whole bitcoin for $30,000 or $60,000. Of course, there are so many people who can't afford that, and you don't have to because there is no minimum budget or savings you need to use Bitcoin. A bitcoin is divisible into extremely small units, much smaller than a US dollar cent. And you can buy a fraction of a bitcoin or earn it. You can start with 10 US dollars or less. So it's not only for the rich. So the criticism that it's only for the rich is completely false. 

It's also false because bitcoin is the first asset in that you can invest without the need to be a certified investor or something like that. And it's permissionless. So basically, basically Bitcoin is financial inclusion. And there are still people who tell us 21 million bitcoin will not be enough. Well, imagine 21 million bitcoin like a pizza. Yeah, you can eat the pizza alone, but if there are eight people coming who want to eat the pizza with you, then you just slice it into more slices. And that is what's happening with Bitcoin. The bitcoin units slice basically bitcoin in small denominations so everyone can have a slice of it. 

And another argument against Bitcoin is if you send bitcoin to the wrong address, they are lost. That's the reason why you always should triple check the Bitcoin address. Yes, it's true. If you send it to a wrong address, you can't get it back because you don't even know who owns that address. 

Another argument is bank account deposits are insured. Bitcoin is not. That's true. If you hold bitcoin in self-custody, you own your money. No one can take it away from you, but also you are not insured. So you have a relatively high level of responsibility. But also remember fractional reserve banking. Banks are not required to keep all your money in their walls. They don't have it. If you go there and want it back, you also don't get it. And then in Europe, yes, for instance, bank account deposits up to 100,000 euros are insured. That's not the case with Bitcoin. But be aware that in times of big financial crisis, these insurances by banks are also not able to pay you back. During the financial crisis in Cyprus in 2013, 47.5% of all bank deposits above 100,000 euros were seized. So the system basically took the money away, that was called not a bailout, that's a bail-in. So basically they take all the money above 100,000 euros you own. Now you might say, but I don't even own 100,000 euros. That's right. But still they can say, okay, it's not 100,000, the level is 5,000. So, there is no difference. And yes, we have these securities or insurances in Europe, but actually the most part of the population lives in countries that don't have these kinds of insurances. Anyhow. So the use for of an uncensorable money, such as Bitcoin where you are in control and not the bank makes complete sense in those countries where people have no safetynes at all, the Bitcoin network gives you the security.
