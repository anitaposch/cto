## Transcript

Mining Bitcoin actually gives you KYC-free coins of course, because if you mine Bitcoin and you mine one block successfully, you will earn the block reward in newly created Bitcoin. This video shows Bitcoin mining machines in Zimbabwe. So if you have free electricity because you have solar and you have enough battery storage or you have access to hydropower, you can set up your own small mining farm and start earning Bitcoin. Of course, if you need to buy the hardware, the special computers (the asics) and all the storage for battery and whatever, then it's a very high investment at the beginning. And that's why actually mostly companies are doing Bitcoin mining, but I just want to show you, it's possible to do it at home as well. And there are many people out there, you can Google it, not Google it, you can duck, duck, go it and find articles of Bitcoiners who are mining their own Bitcoin at home. They show how they have set it up to use the heat from the miners as heating in their houses and things like that. All kinds of creative stuff there.
