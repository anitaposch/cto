Let's take a look into the different forms of Bitcoin wallets. As I said before, a Bitcoin wallet is administrating all your Bitcoin addresses and your private keys and public keys that you need to send and receive and to own bitcoin, but you don't need to care about that in general because that's the job of the software to do that. But there are different types of wallets depending on the device, on the security requirements, and also the supported cryptocurrencies.Tto decide which wallet is best for you, I'm providing now some thoughts and industry standards as a guidance. Ultimately, you have to decide yourself which wallet is the best for you. 

Since Bitcoin is such a novel technology, the wallet software is changing constantly. You need to consider that you will need to do upgrades and sometimes change the wallet manufacturer because of new functionalities. There are constantly new wallets on the market. This should not turn you off. I just want to make you aware of it. In the last few years, I used more and more wallets to test them or to be able to use new functionalities. Therefore, I'm recommending wallets that I have been using myself and that have a very good reputation among industry experts. 

So first, we need to make a distinction between so-called hot storage and cold storage. That's a degree of security difference here. 

**Hot storage:**
So, hot storage are all wallets which are connected to the internet in one or the other way. So you can have a wallet on your desktop computer. The computer is definitely connected to the internet. You can have wallets on your smartphone. The smartphone is also connected to the internet and that's where the danger lies. You can have viruses, you can have hackers that intruded your computer and they all come over the internet. Therefore, if you want to store higher amounts of bitcoin, that's usually where I say if you have bitcoin on a mobile wallet on your smartphone, you should not exceed an amount that's almost the same as you have in your real life purse in of cash in your pocket. 

**Cold storage:**
And a cold storage is a so-called hardware wallet. It's better protected because it's never connected with the internet. You can connect it to your computer or your mobile phone, but the technology is built that way, that this is only a signing device. The bitcoin are not on that hardware wallet. And the hardware wallet only what it does is that you sign transaction while clicking the device. So you have this device which never touches the internet, and at the same time, no hacker, no software that has been intruding, your computer can click the keyboard because they can access the keyboard, but they can't access the hardware wallet device. And that's why we are calling it cold storage. It's not hot storage, which has been exposed to the internet.
