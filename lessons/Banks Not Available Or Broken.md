## Transcript

Another burning use case for people in the Global South is the fact that the banking systems there are either not available to them or they are broken. 

And that's also what Satoshi Nakamoto knew and wrote into his writings. The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's required to make it work. The Central Bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts. That's what Satoshi Nakamoto said. 

And millions of people are unbanked because either they have no identity documents to verify themselves at the banks or they are too poor, or they live too far away from the next bank. And also, interestingly enough, the banking fees in the Global South are more expensive and higher than banking fees, for instance, in Germany or Australia or Canada. You can see South Africa has very high bank fees making the current approach, like the approach of governments etc. to financial inclusion actually unsustainable. So financial inclusion in that sense will never happen. 

So unbanked people can't store their cash safely. They safe in cash, but because of potential damage from animals like rats or because it makes them a target for robbery. And they can't borrow money or else they fall prey to loan sharks. For instance, in Nigeria, a loan shark victim said, they had an interest rate of 45% for 14 days of loans. The solution to that problem is not more regulation, more banks, but it's open access to a secure, neutral, and decentralized money. 

Another problem in African countries is very often the financial illiteracy. So education is a problem. And also they really in need of money, so they fall prey for scams because there are loads of scams running around promising "Join Bitcoin now, in three months, you double your investment" and that's really a big, big problem. And it's also a problem with all the other crypto tokens. Like I think Bitcoin educators must make the difference between centralized institutions and the internet protocol of money like Bitcoin clear to the people. Education is really key, especially when the existing system must not be copied into the future, which was the goal of Bitcoin and Satoshi Nakamoto in the first place. So every centralized cryptocurrency, every CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency) is a closed system and is basically not doing any good. It's not a positive progress. It's the same thing just with a new face.
