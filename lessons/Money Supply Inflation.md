## Transcript

After the learning about what it means that a central bank is a lender of last resort, we are now looking into money supply inflation. So let's take the US dollar as an example, as it's still the most widely used currency around the globe. 

Because of money supply inflation, the more US dollar are available, the less value a single note has. You can imagine a bank note as a commodity like copper. If there is more copper on the market, then there is demand, the price of copper is falling, its value is decreasing. The same is true for your bank note. The value of fiat currency is determined by supply and demand too. If you increase the supply and the demand stays the same, the value of one unit decreases. So as you can see on the slide, there are different forms of money or types of money. 

These are general terms for money within the monetary system. The money supply consists of various types that are generally classified as Ms, such as M0, which is base money M1, M2, and M3. These definitions might be different in some countries, but mostly, there's a general understanding of these definitions. The monetary base M0 is the total amount of a currency in physical paper and coin that is either in circulation in the hands of the public or in the form of commercial bank deposits held in the central bank's reserves. As long as you hold cash, it's an asset like Bitcoin, a property that you own. If you take your cash and store it at the bank, you have a claim, but you don't own the money anymore. That's actually similar to Bitcoin and custodial exchange. Another Fiat money supply M1, M2, M3 is comprised of claims on that base money. So, it includes demand deposits, traveler checks, and other deposits which are easily convertible to cash. On top of that we have M2, which are money market securities, mutual funds, and other time deposits. These assets are less liquid than M1 and not as suitable as exchange mediums, but can be quickly converted into cash or checking deposits.

That M2 money is closely watched as an indicator of money supply and future inflation, and it's a target for the central bank monetary policy. So just look at this chart. The amount of M2 currency in circulation in the United States was 19.7 trillion US dollars in February, 2021. As you can see, in 2020, we had the lockdowns, we had the global pandemic, and in that time, the central bank of the US just inflated the economy with fresh money. 

We accept this as normal because we assume it'll never end. The fractional reserve banking system has functioned around the world for hundreds of years, albeit with occasional inflationary events along the way to partially reset things. Each individual unit of fiat currency has degraded about 99% in value or more over a multi-decade timeline. This means that investors either need to earn a rate of interest that exceeds the real inflation rate, or they need to buy investments instead, which inflates the value of stocks and real estate compared to their cash flows and pushes up the prices of scarce objects like fine Art, says financial analyst Lyn Alden. 

Adding to the money supply inflation is the fact that the population in the US and other western nations is not growing at the same rate as the money supply US population used to grow at maybe 1.5% per year and now grows closer to 0.5% per year. That's pretty important. Meanwhile, broad money supply is up 25% year over year and is on track to be up 75% plus over a rolling five year period in the future, says Lynn Alden. On the image in the slide, you can see how the value of the US dollar has decreased in the last years, in the last a hundred years. 

It shows that purchasing power the Dollar. $1 in 1913 bought you 30 Hershey's chocolate bars. Today you would need to pay $26 for the same thing. So you can see the decline of the value of the US dollar. And on that chart you can see the other way around how the consumer price is going up, up, up, in the last decade.

So strictly speaking, inflation occurs when the money supply outstrips nominal GDP growth, which consists of population and productivity growth. The consumer price index that you can see on the slide, of the USA, shows that the prices for goods went up since the value of money has declined.
