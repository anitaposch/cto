Also a big, big use case, I believe, for Bitcoin is in leveling a little bit the gender inequality in the world. There are lots of barriers for women to own or inherit property or money. 

Of the 1.8 billion unbanked people in the world, 58% are women. So women are overrepresented among the unbanked in most economies. This is true even in economies that have successfully increased the account ownership and have a relatively small share of adults who are unbanked. For instance, in the United States, the Middle East, and in North Africa, two thirds of the unbanked are women. Using a basic bank account is beyond the reach of almost 1 billion women worldwide. 

Varying degrees of gender inequality permitted or mandated by law deny women full financial participation in many countries around the world. Depending on the country, women are discriminated against in inheritance laws and are required to obtain their husband's permission to legally work, get a bank account, register a business, or sign a contract. Many women are banned from entering certain professions. 

Women may also find it more difficult to access legal ID cards due to existing laws or restrictive registration requirements. And such identification is commonly required to use financial products and services. Other hurdles that prevent women from accessing financial services, are the need to travel long distances, the risk of being robbed by accessing money, and lack of privacy that would allow them to protect their savings from others. 

There's a quote from an article called Empowering Women with Rights to Inheritance. It says: "Women are the majority of Kenya's population. They perform 70% of the agricultural labor, but they own less than 1% of the land and control very little of the income produced by their labor." 

Why do I think that Bitcoin is a tool that can empower women? Well, they can hold the bitcoin on their own phone. They can own their own money. They don't have to ask anyone to start using Bitcoin. So basically Bitcoin gives financial inclusion and opens up the opportunities to own money and to also then use that ownership of bitcoin to get loans in the future. There are already new products, or let's say projects coming on, where you can have micro-lending. If you allocate your bitcoin and give it as a security to the project, and when you paid back the loan, you still will get back your bitcoin. So you can use bitcoin as a property and a security for loans in the future. And as we know that many women are taking out these loans to improve their lives and their businesses, this can be really a catalyst to enable more women to own their own money.
