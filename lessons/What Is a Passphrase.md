## Transcript

A lot of people will also advise you on setting up a passphrase. A passphrase is basically a 123th or 25th word. It's a word that you can choose additionally to your seed phrase. So a passphrase is an additional way to secure your funds on top of the seed. 

If you add a passphrase, the wallet software creates an additional wallet that you can use to protect yourself from physical attacks. So if someone gets hold of your seed, they still cannot access your funds because they do not have the passphrase. Well, on the other hand, you already have a pin on your wallet that they need to crack first, but then you would also have a passphrase. 

So as an example, you might want to leave the minority of your funds in the basic non-passphrase wallet and move the majority of your funds to a passphrase protected wallet. The idea behind this is that if you ever find yourself in a situation where someone is trying to extort a ransom from you or puts you under duress, you can safely unlock your wallet and only give the attacker access to the normal wallet with the small amount of funds in it. 

That sounds great, but there are also risks involved because the passphrase is not stored anywhere automatically. You need to take all necessary precautions in order to make sure that the passphrase stays safe and accessible. So you will be needing to make a physical backup, for instance. So it's basically adding another thing that you need to store securely on top of your seed. And if the passphrase is lost, you will not be able to access that wallet anymore. And any coins on that wallet will become inaccessible, meaning the seed doesn't help you then, because you need the passphrase for the wallet. So it's making everything more complicated. With a passphrase, you don't not only need to store your seed, but the passphrase too. Now you have to find long term secure storage for the seed and the passphrase, which you shouldn't put together in one place because that doesn't make any sense. So in most cases, a passphrase is overdoing it. It's making it much more complicated. And if you lose the passphrase, you can't access your funds anymore. 

And also, many people are completely confused by passphrases because they open a new wallet as soon as they set a passphrase. So, for instance, if I were to set a passphrase on a Trezor hardware wallet, for instance, in the software, then I have a part of the wallet that's without a passphrase, and I have a new wallet with a passphrase. I could have additionally wallets with each passphrase I choose, but that gets completely confusing. People don't find their funds anymore because they've put it in one of those passphrases or one of the other. 

So in general, I think single seed is enough. Single seed with a pin on your phone so that, for instance, if your device gets lost or stolen, no one immediately can open your wallet and send funds. So the first thing will be that they need to crack your pin. And in that time, you have hopefully recognized that your wallet is gone and you can send the funds with your seed to another wallet. I mean, of course you can do whatever you want. I just wanted to tell you the options.
