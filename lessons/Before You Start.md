After all these arguments against and for Bitcoin, you might want to start using bitcoin. But before you do that, I want to give a few tips and recommendations and you should note that.

As I said before, there are many other cryptocurrencies. There are even cryptocurrencies which take the name Bitcoin and add something like Bitcoin Cash or Bitcoin Gold or Bitcoin Diamond or Bitcoin Two. These are not cheaper bitcoin. They are completely independent, different assets. They are other cryptocurrencies. They use the name as Bitcoin to benefit from its notoriety, but do not maintain the same strength or popularity as the Bitcoin that go under BTC or XBT on exchanges. Bitcoin is a common good without trademark rights. And that's the reason why it's even possible that other cryptocurrencies go by the name of bitcoin. 

And there's also one thing you should note. So that map is dated. But there's only one country in the world, that's El Salvador, where bitcoin is legal tender at the moment. That does not mean that it's illegal in other countries. There are some countries which are really hostile against bitcoin. And in some countries, there's a banking ban on bitcoin. But in general, everyone is allowed to use bitcoin peer to peer. But it could be that maybe the European Union or any other country decides, we want to ban bitcoin and cryptocurrencies now. That means that you might not be able to get your bitcoin from exchanges if you hold it on an exchange. But if you use it in self-custody and you have your own private keys to your bitcoin, you definitely will still be able to use it, because you will find Bitcoin enthusiasts all over the world who will happily exchange your bitcoin into other currencies or for goods. 

But of course, you need to be vigilant, because if something like that happens, the value of bitcoin could drop very drastically and very fast. But then the same rule applies. You still own the bitcoin. It just has lost value in your national currency. And if you don't need it immediately, just don't panic. It won't be that all countries globally will ban bitcoin at the same time. That won't happen, because also there is competition between the countries. They want to attract Bitcoiners, like, for instance, in El Salvador. They have regulations that are good for Bitcoin investors. They want them to come into their country and that competition between nations will stay. So I don't think that it ever will happen. I mean, nation states can't agree on so many things, so why should they agree on a global ban. But still stay vigilant. 

There's no get rich quick in bitcoin. Whenever someone tells you, invest in bitcoin, you can double your profits. Bitcoin is not a get rich scheme. If anyone tells you you can double your money in short time, remember that guy Mr. Charles Ponzi. 

And if you are waiting to invest in a Bitcoin ETF, then you won't own bitcoin. You won't use bitcoin. You will only be exposed to the price action in bitcoin. You only own and control your bitcoin if you manage your private keys yourself. And that is what I'm going to show you in the following lessons.
