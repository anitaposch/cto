## Transcript

Now, let's dive into the topic of privacy. In this lesson, we are talking about the fact that money is basically a system of control. Why is privacy actually a basic human right? Did you know that privacy is mentioned in Article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights: "No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home, or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honor and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks." 

Interesting, because our privacy is basically all the time being intruded, as soon we, as we open up the internet on our computer, or if we take a smartphone and go for a walk. Having no privacy, it's basically a form of punishment. Have you heard of a panopticon? A panopticon is basically a building that was invented. It's a prison. And in that building, which has a round form, the guards, can see a hundred prisoners at the same time. Meaning it's very efficient in giving people or taking people's privacy away. And that's basically a form of punishment because you never know if someone is watching you or not. And these panopticons we have been building online as well, because you don't know how many trackers are following you every second that you spend on the internet.
