## Transcript

And now we are talking about security. "Security" also in the sense of how can I store my Bitcoin securely? Your Bitcoin are only as secure as your computer is and your devices are, so you actually need to take a little bit care of your devices if you are a Bitcoin user, which is actually a good thing because with using Bitcoin you have really money to lose. So you will be starting to secure your computer a little bit more, which is actually a great effect of Bitcoin. That also your regular digital communication, privacy, and security is increased. That's a great thing actually. 

- **Software setup update**: So the first thing is always do hardware and software setup updates. I'm sometimes also missing one of those updates and not installing it at the first day, in the first moment. I wait a little bit because sometimes there are bugs, but in the end I always do the updates.

- **Passwords**: Well a lot of people still are using passwords like that. They are of course not secure. There's a website, the link is down below bitwarden.com/password-strength where you can test passwords. You don't need to use your real passwords, but just type in one of the passwords you would be thinking of and then you will see that password could be crackes in less than a second. That means don't use passwords like that. Don't use  your birthdate as password or your cat's name or your partner's name or things like that. Use passwords that consist of more words than one, with special characters in between, with numbers, withh small letters, big letters. That's really important to do because if you check back, you will see that it takes centuries to crack a password like this. Of course, you should use one of these passwords only for one account. A lot of people make the mistake to use the same password for various accounts, and the problem with that is that if a hacker gets hold of this password and your email, they can open up every account you have. That's why it's important to have different passwords for all the accounts. You have a different password on Facebook, on Twitter, on Google Mail, wherever. A practical tool for that is a so-called password manager. I can recommend one of those three. I'm personally using Bitwarden, but the other two are also good password managers. What does a password manager do? Well, you open it and you basically give one password for it. So you have a master password. In my case it's a long sentence with numbers and special characters and I can always remember that sentence. And then the tool allows you to create different passwords for each account. So each account has its unique password is securely stored in one of these password managers and you only need to remember one password for it. 

- **Security for your devices**: Be it your computer or your mobile phone. I'm always only using a pin or a pattern. I'm never using biometrics. Why? Because my finger could be hacked off. Someone could kill me and still hold my face into the camera and everything opens up. That's why I'm not using biometrics. That might sound paranoid, but I actually like to be prepared for even the worst case.
