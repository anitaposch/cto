## Transcript

Last but not least, many people might tell you another form of cold storage is a paper wallet. That's true. But the production of a paper wallet is very difficult. It's difficult in that way that it needs to stay secure. And the problem is that those paper wallets are created on websites and you don't know who the person behind that Website is. So, a paper wallet is basically a Bitcoin address with its public and its private key. And then you see printed on it is the QR code for the Bitcoin address. 

And the problem is that either the website where you generate that paper wallet, that Bitcoin keys could be hacked. You don't know what the code does. And on the other hand, the second problem is that your printer is connected to the Internet as your laptop or your desktop computer, and both could be hacked. So it's very insecure. I would never recommend to anyone, or I say the opposite, don't do this. It might be cheaper because it's basically free. But if you can't afford or you can't buy a hardware wallet in your area, then use your mobile phone, use self-custody. And that's better than using these generators. Okay, that's about wallets. Let's go to the next chapter.
