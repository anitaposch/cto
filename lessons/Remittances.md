Another important use case for Bitcoin in the Global South are remittances. Here you can see a chart of the top 10 countries in 2021 in the world who received remittances. So, in the middle you can see the country who received the most remittances in billion US dollars is India. So, 19 billion US dollar have been sent to India in 2021, 54% to Mexico, 53% to China and so on. The most remittances are coming from the US, from Saudi Arabia, from China, and Russia. And then there is this view which shows you the countries that are most depending on the remittances. So, Tonga for instance, almost 40% of the gross domestic product are made of remittances. So, they are highly depending on money coming in from their friends, families, from other countries. On that chart, we can see that in the last years the amount of remittances globally has been going up. And also here we can see the top remittance recipients in the Sub-Saharan African region. As an example, in 2022, in Nigeria we had almost 21 billion US dollars flowing into the country through remittances. Zimbabwe had 2 billion US dollars sent into Zimbabwe. And most dependent here is The Gambia with almost 30% of the GDP coming from remittances, Lesotho and the Comoros. I don't know why Zimbabwe is not on that list, but maybe it's a calculating problem or a problem of public data.

And then there are the fees for remittances. So, the costs of sending an equivalent of US dollars 200 is highly depending on the corridors where you send the money from and to. So, for instance, if you are sending money from Tanzania to Kenya, you pay 35% fees. I mean, that's incredible. Yeah. And so that's definitely a use case for Bitcoin here. The bitcoin transaction fees are not depending on the amount you send, the Bitcoin transaction fees are coming from the data you are sending and not from the amount of money. So, if I were to send you a US dollar, 200 or 2 million, it doesn't matter. The transaction fee could be 30 US dollars cents. And that's also a big, big difference to the traditional banking system. 

And also, there's another thing with remittances. It's a problem that many people then need to go by bus to the next branch of Western Union, for instance. Then you have to wait there in line to receive your cash. Then you have all the cash in your hand and you could be robbed. And that are all things that you don't have with Bitcoin, that you then can receive at home.
