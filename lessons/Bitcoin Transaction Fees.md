## Transcript

Okay, now let's talk about the topic of transaction fees in Bitcoin. It's funny, when I came into the Bitcoin space at the beginning, everyone was speaking about how cheap Bitcoin transactions are, and I really thought that you don't need to pay a fee on it. I don't know why I came to that conclusion, but it's wrong. Now, I want to give you some tips on reducing transaction fees and how it all works. 

If you're looking up a Bitcoin block explorer, like mempool.space, it shows you the upcoming blocks and the blocks that have been mined in the last minutes. And here you can see a real time view of unconfirmed transactions. You can see those on the left hand side. So here at the middle, it's the distinction between mined blocks, and blocks and transactions that are in the mempool. So as you can see here, we had a little bit of congestion. 112 blocks are waiting to be mined. The next thing that you can see is here the average of transaction fees that you have to pay. With low priority means the lower the transaction fee, the slower the transaction will be mined. Why? Because Bitcoin miners are profit-orientated, that means they are looking into the transactions in the mempool and decide to take those with the highest transaction fees into their blocks first. So that's why if you pay higher transaction fees, you are basically in the high priority area, meaning the higher the amount of fee you are willing to pay, the faster your payment will be. As you can see, here is the number of unconfirmed transactions at that moment in time. 

And why do we need transaction fees in the first place? Because as you've learned before, in the year around 2140, after a lot of halving, there will be no block reward anymore, meaning the miners will not get new bitcoin because there will be no more bitcoin issued. The 21 million limit will have been reached at that time, meaning that the miners lose a big part of their income. And as mining is such a profound and important part of the Bitcoin network, because it basically secures all the funds in Bitcoin and the whole Bitcoin network, it's important that the miners also receive money for their work in the future. And that's why there are transaction fees. 

So in your self-custody wallet, you can decide yourself how high you want to set the fee. The wallet will show you a screen where it estimates the time until the transaction will be mined. These are like, you know, you can't really trust them because the situation can change very fast. They are doing an estimate on when your transaction will be mined according to the fee you are setting. But it might be that the next minute, someone comes around and is sending, I don't know, a thousand transactions for a very high fee and then the estimated time of arrival basically is wrong again. So that's all always just an estimate. And as I said before, the higher the fee, the faster the transaction will be settled. You can also set a custom amount of fee, and the lowest custom amount that you can set is 1 satoshi/byte. So if you think you don't need the money immediately in your wallet or something, then you can set a low transaction fee. 

And it's also important to note that the amount of fee you are paying for a Bitcoin transaction is not depending on the amount you're sending. It's not like in the banking system. When you send a high amount, you will pay high fees. You can send, I say like a value of $5 in bitcoin. You can also send a value of 5 billion euros in bitcoin and you will pay the same transaction fee because the transaction fees in Bitcoin are derived from the data size of your transaction.
